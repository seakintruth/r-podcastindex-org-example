# r-podcastindex-org-example
R language example of how to engage with the https://podcastindex.org/ APIs 

# Setup:

1. Install R (from https://cran.r-project.org/)

1. Add your Key and Secret to the 'key.R' file

1. Install dependencies 
  - On Linux use your distro's equivilent of this ubuntu 20.04 example
  ```bash
  sudo apt install libssl-dev openssl curl libcurl4-openssl-dev
  ```
  
# How to run
 - If run interactively the script prompts you for the search terms, `api_key` and `api_secret` with your api and key values provided by https://api.podcastindex.org. 

 - If run from the command line: first argument is all the search terms seperated by spaces, second argument must be the key.R filepath
    ```bash
    $ ./podcasting-index.R "no agenda wayback", "\path\to\file\key.r"
    ```
    
 This is just an example script for API interactivity, for implementation ideas see: [shiny app.](https://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/)
